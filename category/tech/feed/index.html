<p>Typical users can shut down the app, install the new version, and restart the app without issue, but it’s always best to backup everything, especially wallet.dat files, first. The <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.3">v0.17.3 release notes are here</a>.</p>
<p><em>Version v0.17.3 is a direct drop-in replacement for v0.17.1 or v0.17.2, but before upgrading from an older version like v0.15.2, exchanges, services, and anyone who writes code against the API should should check the <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.1">full release notes for v0.17.1</a> as some APIs are deprecated and there are changes to way the config file is read.</em></p>
<h3>Notable Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Rolling Checkpoint Finalization</strong></p>
<p>A <em>finalized</em> block is one which the system considers non-replaceable. If a node receives a sudden chain of blocks which is a &#8220;fork&#8221; of the blockchain going back further than the last finalized block, the fork will be rejected. This makes long attack forks impossible.</p>
<p>Every time a new block comes in, the node will check if a previous block is newly eligible to be finalized. To ensure normal chain function and prevent potential problems, blocks aren&#8217;t eligible until some time passes (see the <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.3">release notes</a> for full details.) This acts like a traditional bitcoin checkpoint, but over time the finalized block rolls forward, hence the name. <strong>The important part is that deep reorganizations become impossible.</strong></p>
<p>Most transactions &#8211; over 60% &#8211; will be in a finalized block when they have just 10 confirmations, but under some rare conditions, it may take 20 confirmations or more. (In 99.92% of the past 100,000 blocks, finalization would have happened by the 19th confirmation.)</p>
<p><strong>RPC Changes</strong></p>
<p>The new RPC call <strong>getfinalizedblockhash</strong> will report the blockhash of the most recent finalized block so that developers can code new behavior around this security information. </p>
<p>Looking forward as always,<br /> <em>The Bitcoin Gold Organization</em></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Please immediately upgrade your BTG Core full nodes to version 0.17.2, published July 2, 2020.</b></p>
<p><span style="color: #662525;"><strong>UPDATE: if you did not upgrade prior to July 10 at 14:00 UTC, you will also want to perform the command:</strong></span><b><br /></b><span style="color: #662525;"><strong>invalidateblock 00000000635620f22ba8694aea532d51619f8cd060f4e42e85db3cb3a5d1c29c</strong></span><b><br /></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>HOW TO UPGRADE:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. You can use the <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/v0.17.2"><b>pre-compiled binaries on Github</b></a>, <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/v0.17.2">https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/v0.17.2</a>, or use the DOWNLOADS link you see above. Simply shut down your node, install the latest version, and start back up.<br /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Manually upgrade from the latest code on the BTCGPU Github </span><a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/v0.17.2"><b>v0.17.2 tag</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (on 0.17 / master branch); full </span><a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">release notes here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. If you are still at v0.15.2 and haven’t upgraded to 0.17, we have a backport version </span><a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/releases/tag/v0.15.3"><b>v0.15.3 tag</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (on 0.15 branch) including the same changes so you can keep your current configuration files.</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: 15px;">(Note: there were potentially breaking changes in the configuration file between v0.15 and v0.17*</span><span style="font-size: 15px;">)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>You can run this command in the console or bgold-cli to ensure you are immediately on the honest chain:<br /></b><b><br /></b><span style="color: #662525;"><b>invalidateblock 00000000635620f22ba8694aea532d51619f8cd060f4e42e85db3cb3a5d1c29c</b></span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 15px;">Note: a strong majority of the honest mining pools have already upgraded their code a week ago, and continue to mine on the honest chain.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">The BTG Explorer at </span><a href="https://explorer.btgofficial.org/" style="font-size: 15px;">https://explorer.btgofficial.org/</a><span style="font-size: 15px;"> is on the honest chain. You can compare your most recent blockhash with the explorer to ensure you are on the honest chain.</span></p>
<p><b>To ask your node for the latest blockhash, give it the command: </b></p>
<p> <b style="font-size: 15px;">getbestblockhash</b><span style="font-size: 15px;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 15px;">And compare it to the latest block on the BTG Explorer at </span><a href="https://explorer.btgofficial.org/" style="font-size: 15px;">https://explorer.btgofficial.org/</a><b></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>====== EMERGENCY INFORMATION ======</b></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 15px;">We have just seen an extremely long attack chain of over 1300 blocks on July 10, 2020, against the BTG network which have been mined since July 1, 2020.</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We detected this illicit activity early on and sent alerts to pools and exchanges to protect them; many closed their wallets over a week ago. We also supplied them with BTG version 0.17.2, which included a checkpoint at block 640650, hash 000000059ec8884fa4fbbdbe46c09cfb4ecba281dfa2351a05084e817c1200ae from July 2 at 2am UTC, mined by MiningPoolHub, a known honest block.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With this block checkpointed, the attacker’s chain could not take over, but this information was not public, and the attacker continued to mine. The attacker mined their secret chain for nearly 10 days, renting power from NiceHash to do so. Today, on July 10, the attacker released over 1300 blocks.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because those attacking blocks are anchored at a block mined on July 1st (before the checkpoint), the honest pools and exchanges who are running the updated code automatically rejected the attacker’s chain.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s time for everyone else to upgrade their nodes to make sure they stay on the honest chain and to push your node onto the honest chain by using the simple command:</span></p>
<p><b style="font-size: 15px;">invalidateblock 00000000635620f22ba8694aea532d51619f8cd060f4e42e85db3cb3a5d1c29c</b></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: 15px;">If you use the Bitcoin Gold GUI, you can enter this command in the Debug Console. If you use the command line daemon, simply give this command to bgold-cli:</span></p>
<p><b>bgold-cli</b> <b>invalidateblock 00000000635620f22ba8694aea532d51619f8cd060f4e42e85db3cb3a5d1c29c</b></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: 15px;">This tells your node that the attacker’s version of the block at height 640650 invalid, and your node will immediately switch back to the honest version of the chain (perhaps after a short recalculation delay.)</span></p>
<p> <span style="font-size: 15px;">The majority of honest pool hashpower continues to mine on the honest chain.</span></p>

<p> _____________________________________________</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">*These changes are aligned with the changes in Bitcoin Core v0.16 and v0.17 and include deprecated RPC commands which are now disabled by default, as well as the introduction of “sections” for testnet and regtest. If you must use deprecated RPCs that are now disabled, you can re-enable them in your config file with the appropriate deprecatedrpc flags. Commands that are not in a section for [test] or [regtest] will only apply to mainnet; see <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.1#configuration-sections-for-testnet-and-regtest">ReleaseNotes</a>. If you use no deprecated commands and use your config file only for mainnet, there should be no breaking changes.</span></p>

<p>Typical users can shut down their node, install the new version, and start their upgraded node without issue, but it’s always best to backup everything, especially wallet.dat files, first.</p>
<p>As promised, BTG strives to stay in-sync with Bitcoin Core’s developing features. BTG Core v0.17.1 parallels features of Bitcoin Core v0.17.1; developers and engineers can expect to see the same changes they already experienced upgrading Bitcoin Core from version 15 to versions 16/17.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Do not use v0.17.1 for in-place node upgrades in production environments without first testing and modifying! This version makes important changes to some APIs and the conf file (see <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/wiki/Release-Notes-v0.17.1">release notes</a>). Also, if you run a full transaction index (most individuals don’t choose to do this), the txindex db will be migrated, which can take many hours before the node is usable again.</p>
<h3>Notable Changes</h3>
<p><strong>Compact Blocks</strong></p>
<p>The most immediately important feature: Compact Blocks are fully implemented on BTG for the first time. This enhancement is critical to support Light Wallet protocols like Neutrino, which enable Lightning wallet and mobile wallet apps to work directly with the BTG network without having to download and store the whole blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet Enhancements</strong></p>
<p>The wallet and user interfaces now fully support Segwit addresses and full native Segwit support is enabled. All new wallets are HD-wallets (hierarchical deterministic &#8211; until now, users still had the option of making a new wallet that was not HD.)</p>
<p><strong>PSBT Support</strong></p>
<p>Bitcoin’s PSBT interchange format is introduced for BTG in this version, though it is not yet supported in the GUI. PSBT allows for transaction creation and signing to be coordinated among multiple parties (for hardware wallets, multisig systems, CoinJoin, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>For Developers and Engineers</strong></p>
<p>With this version, the RPC changes and new ‘label’ API you may know from Bitcoin Core versions 16 and 17 are now in place for your BTG nodes. Developers need to be aware that the deprecated &#8216;getinfo&#8217; API is now retired in favor of more specific calls (<a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/11382" rel="nofollow noopener">see this</a> about the API change) and pool operators need to be aware of the impact to stratum implementation (see <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinGold-mining/node-stratum-pool/commit/292332f7ca77d6ef8119fea0e8f08c7b9e0eb6ec" rel="nofollow noopener">this GitHub example</a> for a guide. )</p>
<p><strong>Summing Up</strong></p>
<p>While this new version is <em>not</em> a hard fork and is <em>not</em> a required update (your current nodes will continue to work just fine), it will be a recommended upgrade for all users because of the many improvements. This updated version of the BTG Core Wallet delivers bug fixes, enhances performance, and delivers critical features that enable many new technologies that have been held back until now.</p>
<p>Looking forward as always,<br /> <em>The Bitcoin Gold Organization</em></p>
<p>Developers and interested parties can see the work on projects like <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/neutrino" rel="nofollow noopener">neutrino</a>, <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/lnd" rel="nofollow noopener">lnd</a>, and other projects on <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU" rel="nofollow noopener">the BTG project’s GitHub</a>.</p>

<h2>About the Bitcoin Gold Endowment</h2>
<p>Since the day they were first mined, the Endowment’s wallets have been public on the BTG blockchain, but rumors and misinformation persist. This post explains the Endowment mining process in detail and lists all of the wallets.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Bitcoin Gold project duplicated (forked) the Bitcoin blockchain as a fair way to distribute 16 million coins, and then launched with an 8000-block mining period to create a 100,000 BTG Endowment to support the future of the project.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As of early August, 2018, about 20,000 BTG have been spent from the Endowment and about 80,000 BTG remain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Endowment is currently the only source of funding for the Bitcoin Gold project; after the formation of the Endowment on the day of launch, 100% of all mining rewards and fees have gone directly to the miners &#8211; exactly as described in our original <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BitcoinGold-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Gold Whitepaper / Roadmap</a>. and detailed in our earlier <a href="../../../premine-endowment/index.html">Endowment </a>post.</p>
<p>The funds we&#8217;ve spent from the Endowment align as described in the Roadmap &#8211; salaries and payments for infrastructure, developers, support staff, travel to promotional events&#8230; we have not spent any funds paying Exchanges to list BTG. Our developers are currently focused on bringing Lightning Network fully to life on BTG, and are working on Atomic Swaps, Smart Contracts, and more!</p>
<p>The whole team is working hard to be Good Stewards of the Endowment so that it can support this project for months and years to come, despite the temporary bear market in cryptos.</p>

<p><em>Note that there is no “new information” in this post&#8211; it is a summary of information that has been publicly available since launch in 2017, either in the public open-source code on <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, or on the BTG blockchain itself.</em></p>
<h3>Recap of how BTG started</h3>
<p>Fork and Launch:</p>
<p><strong>Fork at BTC Block 491406</strong></p>
<p>After <strong>Bitcoin block 491406</strong> was mined on <strong>2017-10-24 01:17:35 UTC</strong>, there were about 16.5 million Bitcoin in existence. At that point, the entire Bitcoin blockchain was duplicated (forked) to establish the starting point of the ledger for BTG &#8211; so BTG blocks 0 through 491406 are identical to those same-numbered Bitcoin blocks (with the addresses converted to BTG format to avoid confusion.)</p>
<p>This new ledger of BTG had the same number of coins in it &#8211; 16.5 million &#8211; each of which was in the control of the same owner as the original Bitcoin (because those people hold the private keys).</p>
<p><strong>BTG Network Launch</strong></p>
<p>On November 12th at 08:34:01, the BTG network was launched and mining began with <strong>BTG block 491407</strong>, the first block mined as BTG, on <strong>2017-11-12 12:34:01 UTC</strong>.</p>
<p><em>There was no mining and no coins were created between 2017-10-24 and 2017-11-12.</em></p>
<p>The mining reward from the first 8,000 BTG blocks formed the Endowment. At a block reward of 12.5 BTG per block, 8000 blocks yields 100,000 BTG, as specified in the original <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/10/BitcoinGold-Roadmap.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bitcoin Gold Whitepaper / Roadmap</a>.</p>
<p>Of those 100,000 BTG, 40,000 were immediately accessible and 60,000 were time-locked for up to 36 months. For safety, security, and control, those 100,000 BTG were mined into 152 different wallets, and all of these wallets are 4/6 multi-sig. (This means there are six private keys for each wallet, and at least four of the six private keys must sign a transaction to move any funds. Each of the six co-founders of the project holds one of these keys.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re good with code, you can confirm what&#8217;s written above by looking at the open-source code in our GitHub: 60% of the funds being time-locked for up to three years <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/blob/5d1e5ce9ab5d4d98cef7b25d30c2391c15558d61/src/chainparams.cpp#L493">can be seen here</a>. Enforcement of the official multisig wallet list is in the consensus rules <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/blob/12ab5f53a6b4b568b87fe9f4d83fc8e9526f38a6/src/validation.cpp#L3030">seen here</a>. If you&#8217;re not good with code, you can read still understand full mining process below, along with a full list of all the Endowment wallets. We include links to the blockchain explorer to make it easy to confirm on-chain.</p>
<p>After the mining of the 100,000 BTG of the Endowment, the total number of BTG rose from 16.5 million to 16.6 million. The Endowment was only 0.6% of the coin supply at the time. (Max future coin supply is 21 million, so the Endowment was 0.476% of the maximum coin supply.)</p>
<h3><strong>Endowment Mining Specifics</strong></h3>
<p><strong>First 3200 blocks (40,000 BTG)</strong></p>
<p>These were mined into four wallets, “round robin” style:</p>
<p>491407 -&gt; Address 1<br />491408 -&gt; Address 2<br />491409 -&gt; Address 3<br />491410 -&gt; Address 4<br />491411 -&gt; Address 1<br />491412 -&gt; Address 2<br />491413 -&gt; Address 3<br />491414 -&gt; Address 4<br />491415 -&gt; Address 1…</p>
<p>… and so on for 3200 blocks. At 800 blocks per wallet, these wallets accumulated 800 * 12.5 = 10,000 BTG each. The wallet addresses are listed below, and are also visible when looking at those block numbers in any BTG blockchain explorer.</p>
<p><strong>The next 4800 blocks (60,000 BTG)</strong></p>
<p>The remaining blocks were divided into roughly 36 segments to unlock monthly over the course of three years. (Dividing 4800 into 36 would actually be 133.33 blocks per segment; instead, 36 segments of 133 blocks were created and a 37th segment with the remaining 12 blocks.)</p>
<p>Each segment was mined round-robin into four wallet addresses, much like the earlier blocks.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>494607 -&gt; Address 5<br />494608 -&gt; Address 6<br />494609 -&gt; Address 7<br />494610 -&gt; Address 8<br />494611 -&gt; Address 5<br />494612 -&gt; Address 6<br />494613 -&gt; Address 7<br />494614 -&gt; Address 8<br />494615 -&gt; Address 5…</p>
<p>During the first 132 blocks of the segment, each address received 33 block rewards of 12.5 BTG, so each received 412.5 BTG. Then, for the 133rd block, the first address received an additional 12.5, bringing the total to 425 BTG in the first wallet.</p>
<p>The total BTG for the segment is 425 + 412.5 + 412.5 + 412.5 = 1,662.5 BTG.</p>
<p>After these 133 blocks were done, mining advanced to the next segment, which did the same procedure into four new wallet addresses which were time-locked for an additional month.</p>
<p>Again, all the addresses in question are 4/6 multi-sig and require four signatures to withdraw funds, in addition to the time locks.</p>
<h3>Complete List of Endowment Wallets</h3>
<p>As of early August, 2018, about 20,000 BTG from the 100,000 BTG Endowment have been spent, and 80,000 BTG remain in the originally mined wallets. Nearly 60% of the current funds remain time-locked.</p>
<p>The complete list of Endowment mining blocks and their wallets follows below, broken into segments as described above. The first column shows the first block mined for each wallet; the second shows for how many months that wallet was locked.</p>
<p>Links go directly to the noted wallet address or block in the <a href="https://explorer.btgofficial.org/">official BTG explorer</a>, but these can be verified in any BTG block explorer or full node.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[We made a fix for a DLL vulnerability that affects BTC and all coins that use Bitcoin's installer methods. We used the fix in our recent Network Upgrade and shared it for the rest of the community's benefit. ]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>Responsible Disclosure</strong></h2>
<p>As you may be aware, Bitcoin Gold has a <a href="../../../responsible-disclosure/index.html">Responsible Disclosure policy</a> listed on the website, which is basically a (bug) bounty program for reporting security vulnerabilities in our stable software versions or infrastructure.</p>
<p>It allows people to safely report an issue to us, and if they follow the rules set out in the Responsible Disclosure policy, we will not take any legal action against them in regard to the report (hacking is still illegal).</p>
<h4><strong>The Report</strong></h4>
<p>Through the end of March, we received only false reports of “non-existing” issues, which we rejected. However, we recently received the first report which our SYSOPS and CERT team could accept. Although the security issue was very minor, we acted on it directly.</p>
<p>It was a DLL vulnerability that affects Bitcoin and all coins that use Bitcoin&#8217;s installer methods (including BTG.) We used the fix in our recent <a href="../../../a-successful-network-upgrade/index.html">Network Upgrade</a> and shared it for the rest of the community&#8217;s benefit.</p>

<p>You might have noticed there was a sizable time span between the report and the fix. That is correct: it takes time to build a fix, especially if the issue stems from a third party module and your entire build process is wrapped around it. It took a long time to test, build, and test again before we could implement the fix as a replacement for our current build process.</p>
<h4><strong>The Fix</strong></h4>
<p>The specific issue addressed by the bug was as follows: Bitcoin Gold uses the NSIS Installer module, which basically wraps our code into a nice install package for people. Our code uses the v2.46 NSIS installer module, the same as in the Bitcoin source. This outdated code had a bug in LoadLibrary: by default, it looks in the current directory of the process and into the Folder of the Executable. This is bad (especially in common use case when users execute our installer from the downloads folder) because an attacker is able to drop a DLL into the Folder of the Executable and give themselves high privileges. To try it out, just place a fake shfolder.dll (which brings up a message box in its DllMain) in the same directory as an NSIS installer and run the installer to see the message box appear. This bug has recently been found in many products and is called ‘.DLL sideloading’ or ‘.DLL hijacking’. Only Windows 7 and very old builds of Windows 8 are vulnerable. An updated Windows 8.1 or any Windows 10 system is not vulnerable.</p>
<p>Although the fix may appear easy (just install the new version 3.03 NSIS installer module!), it is, unfortunately, not that simple. With deterministic builds, we have to make sure the installer matches our code, which involves a lot of trial and error. Also, with our upcoming Upgrade hardfork and another update in the code, all updates needed to be added into the latest releases (as they are mandatory upgrades.)</p>
<p>Our developers did the careful work necessary to implement the new module into the existing build process before our next release. Any developer that is interested in how we resolved the issue can find our fix on our GitHub repo code commit, <a href="https://github.com/BTCGPU/BTCGPU/commit/6cb8c4a68638eb109fe3674ee3f8eed636a4a527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switch to NSIS 3.03 (borrowed some code from TOR project)</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>The (low) Risk</strong></h4>
<p>To be clear, your system had to be compromised in advance for the attacker to have used this vulnerability. The installer software was not compromised, nor was our code modified or hacked. An attacker had to download a malicious .DLL file and put it in the same folder where you downloaded and run the installer. The Bitcoin Gold code, daemon and cli are not affected, nor is any Linux or Windows system (8/10) that is up-to-date. Even if you are running Windows 7, it’s unlikely that an attacker would have been able to download a malicious .DLL file into the right folder at the same moment as you launched the installer. And users would only install a (new) version once on their system.</p>
<p><strong>Our recommendation:</strong> remove any and all previously downloaded installers and only use the latest version from our website or Git repository.</p>
<p>Because this fix was implemented well before our recent Network Upgrade on July 3rd, everyone who downloaded our software or code in preparation for the Upgrade was safe from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>It’s important to note that this issue is not specific to Bitcoin Gold: it can affect any coin that uses Bitcoin’s code as a basis. Some repositories, including Bitcoin itself, are currently vulnerable to this issue.</strong></p>
<p>To ensure awareness of the issues and the fix, we submitted our work to the Bitcoin code repository in this Pull Request: <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/13643">Switch to NSIS 3.03 to avoid DLL hijacking</a>.</p>
<h2>Credits</h2>
<p>The BTG team would like to thank the original Reporter (Shah from <a href="https://fortiguard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FortiGuard Labs</a>), the <a href="https://www.torproject.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TOR Project</a> (where <a href="https://gitweb.torproject.org/tor.git?a=tree;hb=HEAD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helpful code</a> was sourced), and we’d like to call out the efforts of our SYSOPS and DEV teams, who managed the issue and the resolution for us. We’re happy to be able to contribute back to the Bitcoin project and provide a fix which can potentially be used by multiple projects which rely on the Bitcoin codebase.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Mandatory Network Upgrade</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Gold is in the process of a mandatory Network Upgrade. Executing this upgrade requires a hard fork, but we anticipate a smooth upgrade with no chain splits (and no new coins created.)</p>
<p>We have successfully Upgraded the Testnet via hard fork. Our Partners and we are proceeding to finalize the necessary upgrades to related software and preparing for the upcoming Mainnet upgrade.</p>
<p>Our target date for the Mainnet Upgrade is sometime in the first week of July, depending on feedback from critical Partners in the Ecosystem. The actual target will be specified as a block height, not a date.</p>
<h4><strong>Technical Changes:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>Implement new PoW: <a href="../../../equihash-btg/index.html">Equihash-BTG</a>
<ul>
<li>“Equihash-BTG” is Equihash&lt;144,5&gt; with BTG-specific Personalization</li>
<li>(Old PoW was “Equihash,” which is Equihash&lt;200,9&gt; with generic implementation)</li>
<li>See <a href="../../../equihash-btg/index.html">https://btgofficial.org/equihash-btg/</a> for more detail.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Deliver improved Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm
<ul>
<li>New DAA is LWMA with optimized parameters</li>
<li>(Old DAA was Digishield v3 with inferior parameters)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Goals:</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li>ASIC resistance
<ul>
<li>Equihash-BTG is dramatically more ASIC-resistant than the generic Equihash, rendering the recently-available <a href="../../../a-response-to-the-asic-threat/index.html">Equihash ASICs ineffective for mining BTG</a></li>
<li>Equihash-BTG will probably make future ASIC designs non-competitive for a significant period of time</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Safety
<ul>
<li>PoW &amp; personalization changes create BTG-specific hashpower, and therefore a new “hashpower market segment” specific to BTG</li>
<li>BTG will be the dominant coin in the Equihash-BTG hashpower market, increasing <a href="../../../responding-to-attacks/index.html">security against 51% attacks</a></li>
<li>Although we expect Equihash-BTG rental markets to emerge quickly, they will be more transparent because there is only one practical use for Equihash-BTG hashpower. This means easier monitoring for potentially malicious activity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consistency and Regularity
<ul>
<li>New DAA (Difficulty Adjustment Algorithm) delivers much better responsiveness to hashpower shifts (which happen due to changing market prices and hashpower market dynamics)</li>
<li>This will smooth out block times, reducing the incidence of “fast” and “slow” periods</li>
<li>Will also increase average profitability for “steady miners” of BTG</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>[table id=2 /]</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>Mining Software and Pools</strong></h4>
<p>The first few Equihash-BTG capable miners for NVidia cards are already available, and we expect AMD-based miners to be available soon. We will begin maintaining a list of known compatible mining software and expected mining pool availability on the Forum as details become publicly available from the 3rd parties who make and maintain them.</p>
<h3><strong>In Closing</strong></h3>
<p>We’re very happy with the cooperation we’re getting from many of our Partners in the Ecosystem, but also from the community of Equihash-based coin teams with which we’ve been collaborating these past weeks. We know some wish this Upgrade could be delivered sooner, but coordinating with all our Partners and ensuring the mining infrastructure is ready are crucial to minimize disruption &#8211; and, of course, critical for safety.</p>
<p>We look forward to sharing many additional details in the next few days!</p>
<p>Improving every day,<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><strong>Summary:</strong></h4>
<p>Our current mining algorithm, Equihash, is used by many different coins without any personalization. It was originally developed by Zcash and based on the parameter set &lt;200,9&gt;. We are going to upgrade to Equihash with a the parameter set &lt;144,5&gt;, with some customization. We’ll call it “Equihash-BTG,&#8221; for now. This will keep our blockchain ASIC-resistant and add an immediate measure of safety from 51% attacks.</p>
<h3><strong>About Equihash</strong></h3>
<p>Equihash, which was first developed and used by Zcash, was designed from the outset to be an “ASIC-resistant” Proof of Work algorithm. The developers set out to accomplish this by making it a <em>memory-hard</em> algorithm. (See the <em><a href="https://www.cryptolux.org/images/b/b9/Equihash.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biryukov and Khovratovich paper on Equihash</a>.</em>) What does this mean, how does it make mining ASIC-resistant?</p>
<p>A memory-hard algorithm is one which <em>requires</em> a lot of memory to be able to run. It simply won’t work on hardware that doesn’t have enough memory.</p>
<p>When making an ASIC &#8211; an <em>Application-Specific Integrated Circuit</em> &#8211; adding memory is very expensive, and the more memory you need, the more expensive it gets. With a high enough memory requirement, building a “single-chip solver” on an ASIC becomes so expensive that you could not hope to earn enough in mining to pay for the ASIC. It’s <em>impossible</em> to profit.</p>
<p>Equihash was engineered to make that to happen &#8211; it can be configured to need a lot of memory as a minimum requirement to run, and it needs several times that much to run efficiently. (If you use half the ideal amount of memory, it can be 1000 times slower.)</p>
<p>Exactly how much memory is required? That depends on a couple of parameters.</p>
<h3>The current Equihash: &lt;200,9&gt;</h3>
<p>Equihash is the name for the general algorithm, but the exact implementation depends on two parameters, &lt; <em>n</em>, <em>k</em> &gt;. Today&#8217;s common Equihash coins run on Equihash &lt;200,9&gt;, so <em>n</em> = 200 and <em>k</em> = 9. This setup is currently used interchangeably by Bitcoin Gold, Zcash, Zencash, and many other Equihash-based cryptos.</p>
<p>This &lt;200,9&gt; version of Equihash requires a minimum of 50 MB of memory but can run much faster with 144 MB of memory. This was not the most demanding (most <em>memory-hard</em>) version of Equihash considered at the time, but it appeared to be &#8220;good enough.&#8221; These memory requirements were previously sufficient to prevent building an ASIC, based on the comparison of ASIC cost to coin value a year or two ago. Since then, Zcash &#8211; which was worth $30 in Feb of 2017 &#8211; has grown to be worth over $250, and now there are multiple coins that can be mined with the same Equihash. Meanwhile, the cost of transistors in an ASIC has gone down.</p>
<p>With these changes, it became possible to build an ASIC that can work with just enough memory to profitably mine the current Equihash coins &#8211; and this is precisely what <a href="../../../a-response-to-the-asic-threat/index.html">has come to pass</a>. But this doesn’t mean that Equihash is defeated &#8211; just that Equihash &lt;200,9&gt;.</p>
<h3>Equihash-BTG: &lt;144,5&gt;</h3>
<p>We’ll be adopting different parameters, &lt;144,5&gt;, for Equihash-BTG. Although these numbers are smaller than &lt;200,9&gt;, it means the algorithm actually requires <em>dramatically more</em> memory to run &#8211; so much more that we believe ASICs will be impossibly unprofitable for quite some time. The &lt;144,5&gt; parameters require a minimum of 700 MB to run and use about 2.5 GB to run efficiently (that’s 17 times larger!) This should be too expensive to produce with an ASIC right now, while most graphics cards used by our miners already have that much memory or more.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve seen the innards of the Z9 Equihash miner, and we&#8217;re no longer concerned that it might be able to mine Equihash-BTG effectively. We&#8217;ve tested the new algorithm with typical graphics cards and have confirmed that they can run the new algorithm with as little as 3GB of RAM (although it can be a bit tricky under Windows if trying to mine while still using the computer.)</p>
<p>The sheer amount of memory required for Equihash-BTG pretty much <em>forces</em> the use of DRAM, which calls for a dramatically different design than a single-chip solver for regular Equihash. Even if a specialty miner is developed for Equihash-BTG in the future, it will not have as dramatic an advantage over a GPU as the specialty Equihash &lt;200,9&gt; miners. This significantly decreases the threat ASICs can pose to our network. While we know that this parameter change is not a permanent fix &#8211; this one change won’t stop ASICs forever &#8211; we know it will solve the ASIC-resistance problem for now, and gives us time to consider other alternatives for the longer term, if necessary.</p>
<p>The new parameters in Equihash-BTG also provide a few other advantages over &lt;200,9&gt;, which you can read about in our more detailed <a href="https://forum.btgofficial.org/t/our-new-equihash-equihash-btg/1512">Forum post about Equihash-BTG</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Enhanced Safety</strong></h3>
<p>The new algorithm doesn&#8217;t just protect us from ASIC miners &#8211; it moves us into a different &#8220;pool&#8221; of hashpower, which also gives us a measure of safety against the kind of <a href="../../../responding-to-attacks/index.html">51% attacks </a>against Exchanges that happened over three or four days this past May.</p>
<p>Why does the new algorithm make us safer? It has to do with the size of the pool of hashpower available as Equihash. The total supply of power is large because it&#8217;s currently used interchangeably by multiple coins, and some of those coins produce new coins quite liberally &#8211; they generate a lot of miner rewards, which attracts a lot of hashpower, making the total pool very big. Though the share of power available for rental may be a small fraction of the total power for all coins, it can be a large share compared to individual coins, such as Bitcoin Gold. When the power available to rent on demand is larger than the power mining our coin, our chain is potentially at risk of attack (if someone has the financial means to rent all of that hashpower while simultaneously having the resources to make an enormous double-spend attempt against an exchange.)</p>
<p>Because Equihash-BTG is <em>different </em>from the existing pool of regular Equihash power, we&#8217;ll effectively be in a separate pool of power. This means BTG will dominate the hashrate on this new PoW algorithm, which is &#8220;personalized&#8221; to BTG, adding a layer of incompatibility versus other coins that will be moving to the &lt;144,5&gt; parameter set, such as BTCZ (we&#8217;ve been collaborating with many other coin teams in the space.)</p>
<h3><strong>Timing and Future Updates</strong></h3>
<p>While we&#8217;re very close to being able to provide Release Candidate versions of all the software to the public, we still aren&#8217;t ready to commit to a specific fork date. We&#8217;ll begin releasing detailed information about progress with the code and timing to all of our partners in the coming days to assist them in preparations. Because this kind of Network Upgrade will be enacted via Hard Fork, we need to be sure our partners are prepared. (A Hard Fork does not mean there will be a new coin &#8211; it just means that the prior software won&#8217;t be compatible, so the Upgrade is not optional.) Our ecosystem includes dozens of partners, including mining pools, miners, the makers of mining software, blockchain explorers, wallet hardware and software providers, third-party merchant services, and over fifty exchanges! We&#8217;re doing our utmost to ensure that <em>everyone</em> in our community has the opportunity to prepare so that nobody is left behind when the time of the Upgrade comes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re going to share some details and analysis of our blockchain&#8217;s performance. Although our <a href="../../../growing-bitcoin-gold-ecosystem/index.html">Ecosystem</a> has been growing rapidly, we know a few parties (including a small number of exchanges) were waiting to see if the new &#8220;blockchain is stable.&#8221; With this post, we plan to lay out what we feel is compelling evidence about that and hope to explain some possible misunderstandings.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>The key element here is the Bitcoin Gold blockchain, which is maintained by an independent network of thousands of computers doing calculations to process and secure transactions. Just like the Bitcoin and the Bitcoin Cash blockchains, the BTG blockchain is designed to produce blocks at an average interval of ten minutes, but the actual time to find any particular block is a random distribution, based on a &#8220;race&#8221; between those thousands of computers. A block might be found in two minutes, but might take twenty. It&#8217;s the average time that matters.</p>
<p><strong>Our network&#8217;s block generation rate has been steady, </strong>finding new blocks as planned after the expected burst in the first 24 hours after MainNET Launch. After public mining began, the per-block Difficulty adjustment algorithm ratcheted up the Difficulty rapidly in response to a massive influx of mining hashpower, eventually stabilizing the average block find time at the target 600 seconds (ten minutes.)</p>
<p>Since then, the overall network Hashrate has been fluctuating significantly, as should be expected &#8211; the market for GPU hashpower is competitive, and responds rapidly to changes in market prices of multiple different cryptocurrencies. Our Difficulty adjustment algorithm quickly compensates for these conditions and has maintained an average time to find a block that is very close to the 600-second target.</p>
<h2>Variability in Hashrate and the Difficulty Setting</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s a mistake to focus on fluctuations in the actual Hashrate and the Difficulty: a varying Hashrate is entirely expected, and the changing Difficulty is designed specifically to compensate for the varying Hashrate. This is how the BTG blockchain produces a relatively constant block find time <em>despite</em> a fluctuating GPU hashpower market.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s important to recognize that changes in Difficulty are just a means to an end: what matters is the time to find blocks.</strong> It is explicitly because our Difficulty responds rapidly that none of the following problems have been occurring:</p>
<ul>
<li>a drop in block time, due to incoming hashpower, which happens when BTG price rises or prices fall</li>
<li>an increase in block time, due to outgoing hashpower, which happens when BTG price falls or other prices rise</li>
<li>any dramatic change in block times when a significant amount of hashpower enters or leaves, whether based on whim or malicious intent</li>
</ul>
<p>We&#8217;re pleased that our adjustment algorithm (a variant of Digishield V3) has been so efficient. Some might recall that we adjusted the algorithm during the Testnet period in early November. We considered it critical to get the adjustment algorithm working right &#8211; not to do so would be careless and could be harmful to other coins in the ecosystem. <strong>Bitcoin Gold always strives to be a Friendly Fork</strong>, so we&#8217;re pleased to have had no adverse impact on our predecessor coin, Bitcoin.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also become aware that some people have the mistaken notion that our block times are not stable because, quite frankly, they&#8217;ve seen <strong>some new charts they&#8217;re not familiar with!</strong> Traditional blockchain explorers graph the average time <em>per day</em> for Bitcoin and for Bitcoin Cash (one day is roughly 144 blocks), but some of the new explorers for Bitcoin Gold are reporting the find time <em>per block</em>. This new reporting made sense &#8211; after all, the Bitcoin system only adjusts the Difficulty once every 2016 blocks (about two weeks), so showing the daily average is fine. The Bitcoin Cash system added an EDA (Emergency Difficulty Adjustment) to compensate for fluctuations but was still based on a two-week adjustment. It was only after Bitcoin Gold came along with a per-block adjustment that it made sense to start reporting on a per-block basis.</p>
<p>These two different views &#8211; <em>per day</em> averages versus <em>per block</em> reporting &#8211; make for very different pictures, and you just can&#8217;t compare them. If we compare these three chains directly, using the same method for all, we&#8217;ll see that Bitcoin Gold does well.</p>
<h2>Some Hard Data: Scatter Plots</h2>
<p>Here are three scatter plots &#8211; The first is original Bitcoin, the second is Bitcoin Cash, and the third is Bitcoin Gold. All three chains have a target Difficulty of 10 minutes (600 seconds), and all three have the same timescales. Each dot represents the time to find one particular block, and the black line shows a 72-block moving average. (With a ten-minute target, 72 blocks should be about 12 hours.)</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days.html"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1623 size-large" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days-940x1024.png" alt="" width="940" height="1024" srcset="https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days-940x1024.png 940w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days-275x300.png 275w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days-768x837.png 768w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days-610x665.png 610w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Last-14-Days.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px" /></a></p>
<p>(Note: the vertical scale is limited to 1200 seconds to make fluctuations in the average block time clear. All three blockchains have significant numbers of outliers well above 1200 seconds which are not shown here, but they are included in the averages.)</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>What&#8217;s a scatterplot? Each dot represents how long it took to find one block. A dot at height 120 means that block took 120 seconds (two minutes) to find, and a block at 1,200 took 20 minutes to find. Every block goes into the scatterplot.</p>
<p>The black line shows the average time of the preceding 72 blocks. Since the process is intended to take about ten minutes per block, the black line should average around 600 seconds. So while the dots show you actual block times, and the black lines show you if the average has been running high, or low. (Ten minutes times 72 blocks should be twelve hours, so the black line is a kind of twelve-hour average.)</div></div>
<p>These plots of the block times and line graphs of the average time show that Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin Gold are all exhibiting typical variability, but their averages are hovering around the 600-second target. Bitcoin is a touch more stable than the other two coins; this is likely a natural result of the fact the Bitcoin usually has more miners working on it than the other two currencies.</p>
<p>Although we&#8217;ve been stable for these two weeks, some people might ask why we don&#8217;t show the entire period since launch. It&#8217;s a fair question. There are two reasons: firstly, we had a very rapid series of blocks in our first day, both from establishing the <a href="../../../premine-endowment/index.html">Endowment</a> and from the ramp-up afterward as massive new distributed hashpower came into our network. (Remember that we were not a live split at fork time which would capture a share of existing Bitcoin hashpower &#8211; our new network stood up from scratch, so after Launch, it needed to start from zero.) So it took a little time for our blockchain to stabilize.</p>
<p>The second reason: a few hours after our launch, on November 13th, Bitcoin Cash performed a hard fork to modify their Difficulty adjustment algorithm, and their network also needed time to stabilize. Using the first few days of our launch would not be fair to either Bitcoin Cash or to Bitcoin Gold.</p>
<p>In the end, we feel that these two weeks paint a fair picture of the current state of all three of these blockchains. However, to be comprehensive and transparent, we&#8217;re also publishing two more scatter plots covering earlier periods.</p>
<p>The second plot shows the time of our Launch, along with the ten days before and the ten days after, for 21 days, total. The vertical scale (seconds) has been increased to capture the broader fluctuation range of the 12-hour moving average in this period.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-1624 size-large" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10-941x1024.png" alt="" width="941" height="1024" srcset="https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10-941x1024.png 941w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10-276x300.png 276w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10-768x836.png 768w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10-610x664.png 610w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Plus-Minus-10.png 1025w" sizes="(max-width: 941px) 100vw, 941px" /></a></p>
<p>Above, you can see that the Bitcoin Gold blockchain started with a low Difficulty, and rapid blocks, followed by a quick rise as the system brought the network towards a 10-minute average despite a massive influx of hashpower after pools pointed their miners at the network.</p>
<div class='et-box et-info'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>Although Bitcoin average block times spiked just before the Bitcoin Gold launch (blocks were taking a long time) and the rate dropped back to normal afterward, this was unrelated to Bitcoin Gold. The slow block times happen when Bitcoin loses a lot of mining power to Bitcoin Cash, which also results in very rapid blocks in the Bitcoin Cash side: you can see this kind of shift on November 11 and 12. Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash share the same type of miner, so price fluctuations between the two coins can cause miners to shift from the one to the other.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Gold uses GPU miners, so it doesn&#8217;t affect Bitcoin. The GPU mining market is competitive and varies, too, but our per-block Difficulty adjustment compensates for these fluctuations.</div></div>
<p>Lastly, to help show the &#8220;big picture,&#8221; this last chart shows the entire lifespan of Bitcoin Gold, starting one week before the fork (the gold-colored point in the Bitcoin plot on October 24th is the forked block), and running all the way through December 6th.</p>
<p><a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1673" src="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December.jpg" alt="Per-second scatter plot from pre-fork through December" width="1025" height="1116" srcset="https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December.jpg 1025w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December-276x300.jpg 276w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December-768x836.jpg 768w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December-941x1024.jpg 941w, https://btgofficial.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Week-before-fork-through-December-610x664.jpg 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px" /></a></p>
<p>Again, the vertical scale has been adjusted to account for higher peaks on moving averages.</p>
<div class='et-box et-shadow'>
					<div class='et-box-content'>The gold dot on 10/24 in the Bitcoin chart was the Fork Block; prior to that block, Bitcoin and Bitcoin Gold share identical histories.This is reflected in the Bitcoin Gold chart&#8230; and we can see that different blocks started getting mined after Launch on 11/12.</div></div>
<p>The raw data for these scatter plots is publicly available, becasue each blockchain contains the timestamps. They are <a href="../../../wp-content/uploads/2017/12/raw-data.html">available here as a CSV</a> for convenience for those who would like them &#8211; and please let us know if you have questions or comments.</p>
<p>We hope this helps clarify any misunderstandings and makes quite clear that <strong>the Bitcoin Gold Blockchain is Stable, and has been a Friendly Fork.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Hello everyone! </em></p>
<p><em>We take the opportunity of this update to inform you of the latest news of BTG network tests and to invite all of the miners that are planning to participate in this project to test their machines in the Bitcoin Gold test blockchain.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin Gold testnet is proving the stability and security of the network, including the new difficulty adjustment algorithm and two-way replay protection, and is helping wallets, pools, and application developers to integrate BTG and fully <strong>prepare for the imminent mainnet launch</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>What’s a testnet?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A testnet is a temporary blockchain used for testing the network. <strong>Testnet coins are useless and distinct from real Bitcoin or Bitcoin Gold</strong> (they are never supposed to have any real value). A testnet allows application developers and security researchers to perform experiments without having to risk losing real money or worry about breaking the main blockchain. </span><a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet</span></a><br />
</br></p>
<h4><strong>Who should use the testnet?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin Gold testnet can be useful for people who want to test the p2p network and consensus rules before the launch of the mainnet. Some of the more common uses of the testnet are for:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pool operators</strong>: Test the setup and the integration of Bitcoin Gold into their mining pools and test end-to-end CPU/GPU mining.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Wallet developers</strong>: Test the integration of Bitcoin Gold into their software or hardware wallets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Exchanges</strong>: Test on-chain transactions.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Pro users</strong>: Test security features like replay protection.</span></li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em>Dear followers of Bitcoin Gold project.</em></p>
<p><i>We are excited about the way the testnet is working.</i></p>
<p>On the second day we have applied changes about the starting difficulty, some more minor settings and restarted the network. Currently we have 57 operating nodes and more than 200 mined blocks. The <strong>network is stable</strong> and all of the transactions are executed.</p>
<p>Changes required:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently we are <strong>not experiencing any issues</strong> of the network. We see that the difficulty is dynamically adjusted and the block time is between 3 minutes and 24 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are in touch with major exchanges and wallet providers that have asked for the replay protection and the unique address format in order to support us, follow their statements and start working on integration with Bitcoin Gold. So <strong>all the users can receive their funds</strong> without any problems.</li>
<li>We will start planning the release of the main network very soon and will come up with release date as soon as we are ready to announce it.</li>
<li>Go to previous <a href="../../../replay-protection-development/index.html">BTG Daily Update </a>to check our <strong>complete timeline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<div class="text_exposed_show">
<p>Why a Testnet?</p>
<p>Testnet is for testing new features before the mainnet launch. Bitcoin Gold testnet can be useful for pool operators, pro users and exchanges/wallets developers who are willing to <strong>test security</strong>, on-chain<strong> transactions</strong> and setup the integration of BTG.</p>
<p>We want to inform all the BTG community that this is a testnet mining. The testcoins have <strong>no real value</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p><em>We take advantage of the opportunity to thank to users, pools operators, wallets and exchanges that are helping with the development and the testnet progress.  </em></p>
<p><em>All the received help is highly appreciated! Thanks for all of the support!</em></p>
<p><em>Bitcoin Gold community.</em></p>
